    h2 Hey there! I'm Beth.
    p I'm a professional software developer in Ithaca, NY.  

    p When I'm not coding, you might find me re-binge-ing The Office, studying French, or pleading to the videogame gods for better teammates in Halo 5 multi-player. I also like to draw and volunteer.

    p At work and in life, I aim to emulate my biggest values: compassion and continuous growth. Aside from all the mushy stuff, I believe compassion can lead to clearer communication, better code, and more insightful solutions to problems - all things which benefit the users, coders, and business alike. I take initiative to ensure that my peers have the support they need to grow because I know that great software comes from great teams.
